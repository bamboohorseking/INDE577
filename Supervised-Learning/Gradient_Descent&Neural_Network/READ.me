## Gradient Descent, Neural Network I 
By: Shiyuan Wang
In this assignment, I will use linear regression to fit the dataset in the begining.  I will also use neural network model and gradient descent method to fit the dataset again. And I will make comparisions between those 2 models.

The following packages will be needed to run the code below:


*   matplotlib.pyplot: [documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html)
*   numpy: [documentation](https://numpy.org/devdocs/)
*   pandas: [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
*   sklearn: [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
