## Data
In this assignment, we will explore KNN method on adataset named "Red wine". It contains 1599 samples,12 columns. Download link is: [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)
* fixed acidity
* volatile acidity
* citric acid
* residual sugar
* chlorides
* free sulfur dioxide
* total sulfur dioxide
* density
* pH
* sulphates
* alcohol
* quality
