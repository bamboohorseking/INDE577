# Ensemble_Learning &  Random_Forest
By: Shiyuan Wang

## Objectives:
In this project, I will build three models:
* Ensemble model
* Random Forest Model
* Bagging Model

And I will compare the model performance for those 3 models.

## Data
In this project, we will explore Ensemble_Learning &  Random_Forest algorithm on a dataset named "Red wine". It contains 1599 samples,12 columns. Download link is: [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)
* fixed acidity
* volatile acidity
* citric acid
* residual sugar
* chlorides
* free sulfur dioxide
* total sulfur dioxide
* density
* pH
* sulphates
* alcohol
* quality

## Packages
The following packages will be needed to run the code below:
*   matplotlib.pyplot: [documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html)
*   numpy: [documentation](https://numpy.org/devdocs/)
*   pandas: [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
*   plotly.express: [documentation](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/)
*   sklearn: [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
