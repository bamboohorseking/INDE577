This project focuses on the linear regression technique with lagged Time-Series variables. In this project, I will build model with bias and without bias to see the difference between those 2 models. 

## Data
In this project, I am going to work with the stock data of Gamesstop company(GME) from 2021-01-01 to 2021-05-31.

*   matplotlib.pyplot: [documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html)
*   numpy: [documentation](https://numpy.org/devdocs/)
