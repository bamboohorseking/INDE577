# Supervised Learning 

## Definition: 
Supervised learning is an approach to creating artificial intelligence, where a computer algorithm is trained based on input data that has been labeled for a particular output. The model is trained until it can detect the underlying patterns and underlying relationships between the input data and labels, enabling it to yield accurate labeling results when presented with never-before-seen data.
It is good at classification problems and regression problems. And for the project in this course, I used most of the algorithm on classifying the red wine dataset.
