## Data
It is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. The access website link is: [access link](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)

Detials about this dataset:\
**Labels**:\
Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

| Index | Label |
| --- | --- |
0 |T-shirt/top
1 |Trouser
2 |Pullover
3 |Dress
4 |Coat
5 |Sandal
6 |Shirt
7 |Sneaker
8 |Bag
9 |Ankle boot
