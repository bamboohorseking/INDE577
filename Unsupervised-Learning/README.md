# Unsupervised Learning

## Definition: 

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from datasets without human intervention, which means it does not have labels for model to train itself. 

The most common unsupervised learning method is cluster analysis, which applies clustering methods to explore data and find hidden patterns or groupings in data.
